Problems: 

# I need to call the classes from different files so that I will be working on them separately.
		# not at this project. It is too simple of a project for that. Work on the frames.		
# Understand how the frames stacking works before working again on that. Try to see how does one frame affects the next one.
# Try to put the classes on different mediums. Maybe it helps.
# Create a text page where the user can write about his/her day. Text only, nothing fancy. 
# Can use progress bar if one requires a certain amount of words to be asked to reply.
# MenuBar : File/Option/... Can this be useful? I can change the whole thing. I can maintain one single layer and change the settigns accordingly. It would be great. :D

Helpful tips:
	# try to create the hierarchy of the widgets according to their placing.  
	# button has the "default" option which tells Tk that the button is the default button that user is using(if Enter is pressed or the like)
	# check usage of button.invoke()
	# use combobox for background or Listbox(use code in tkdocs.com)
		"""
			countryvar = StringVar()
			country = ttk.Combobox(parent, textvariable=countryvar)
			country.bind('<<ComboboxSelected>>', function)
		"""
	# use stick for grid manager
	# use "forget" and "remove" options for Pause.
