# Project Title: Irenka

## Prerequisites and Coding style
Depending on what you downloaded:
If you downloaded python file and want to work on it yourself: python3 is required to make changes, pyinstaller to create an executable file for windows. 
If you downloaded the zip file then only a operating system to run it is required(any normal computer).

pyinstaller irenka_menubar.py
OR
pyinstaller irenka_shqip.py 

Coding style:
irenka_menubar.py and irenka_shqip.py which are useful for the moment are coded in procedural style.<br />
irenka_oop.py is coded in object oriented programming style.<br />
Following will be that the procedural style files will be turned to object oriented programming for consistency requirements.<br />

## Built With

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - A text editor for python3
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - A text editor

## Game Rules:
This will be a word-game which is based on one simple rule: say what you first thought, sincerely.<br />
The game will bring random words to you from a list of words.<br />
You have 10 seconds to write something.<br />
If 10 seconds pass your game finishes.<br />
The word asked and your written text will be registered in a history.<br />
The history can be downloaded to your folder directly after the game is finished.<br />
Honesty: Do not write meaningless words.<br />

## Data and Non-Functional Requirements:

The data format will be in a list of strings or in a text file(txt).<br />
Later version: Do you want to upload your own list of words?<br />
The beginning words will be in English for no reason.<br />
There will be an Albanian dictionary in the next version.<br />
The GUI experience should be smooth. No interruptions expected. <br />
There should be different colors so that the user will feel home and comfortable.<br />
Songs in the background can be added to improve experience.<br />
  
## Notes: 
For music:   might need either parallel computation of the both threads, or might need more work. Re-consider it.<br />
For downloading a file:    not much information, check it again.<br />
For reading file in exe:    check the documentation again. <br />
