1. Read from newspapers only the useful information, without advertisements(No-Advertisements).
    * Scrape with bs4. 
    
2. Measure Sentiment of the information.
    * Use Vader for English language. 
    * Use sklearn's vectorized work for the Albanian version. (todo)
        * Make use of the stemming-word method. 
        
3. Collect news articles for creating a classifier. (here)
    * Should be both in English and Albanian.
    * Classifier should have heuristic(logical) classes.
    * Can be Supervised at first, and unsupervised next. 
    
4. Create a text classifier for news type.
    * Understand different classifiers, pick one according to your knowledge.
    * Check its accuracy.
    * Check the others and analyse your choice.
    
5. Recommend which news to read with an email. 
    * Create accounts
        * Use Auth of Firebase
    * Recommendation system based on shown user-preference (cold-start).
    * Add history based recommendations to the user. 
        * Content based recommendations (usage of sparse matrix of data)
        * Collaborative filtering based on customer segmentation language and locality based.
