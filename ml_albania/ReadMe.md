This is an analysis of social factors affecting the life-quality in the country I come from : Albania. This is a start of analysis, not a complete analysis. The data will be taken from these sources: <br />

  * INSTAT : http://www.instat.gov.al/ <br />
  * knoema : https://knoema.com/atlas/Albania <br />
<br />
The analysis will be in form of regression in order to understand underlying dynamics of the society and to explain undergoing economical and social processes.<br />

## To do:
<br />
  * Education analysis <br />
  * Economic expectancy <br />
  * Job Opportunities <br />
  * Life quality analysis <br />
  * Gender equality analysis <br />

## Methods to be used: 
<br />
  1. Linear regression<br />
  2. Multiple Linear regression<br />
  3. Polynomial regression<br />
  4. Support vector regression<br />
  5. Decision tree regression<br />
  6. Random forest regression<br />
<br />

<b>Note:</b> <br />
These are not real analysis in terms of expanatory causes. <br />
This is just a starting point in understanding what are the underlying mathematical correlations between time and X-social factor. <br />
